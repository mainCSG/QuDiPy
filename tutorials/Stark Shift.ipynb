    "# QuDiPy tutorial: Using the Stark shift module\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show how to use the Strak shift module to determine the deviation in $g$-factor arising from an applied electric field in the z-direction, where the plane of a device would be in the xy-plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be defining the potential and the electric field that the dot(s) reside in analytically and therefore the xy-confining potential and the z-direction electric field will be decoupled. However, in practice with NextNano potentials, these two values will not be decoupled. The goal is to make this tutorial with NextNano potentials in due time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a wavefunction approximating the ground state wavefunction in each dot must be provided. This fixed wavefunction is then used in a varying electric field to calculate the $g$-factor deviation. This is an approximation since the gorund state wavefunction will be slightly perturbed when gate voltages are changed. In the future, we hope to implement a many-body electron wavefunction which would allow us to bypass this step and give us a more accurate value for the $g$-factor for each electron.\n",
