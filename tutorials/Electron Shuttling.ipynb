This can be done using the `.find_resonant_tc()` method of the `potentialInterpolator` object `pot_interp`. This method varies a specified control variable (in this case, we will vary *V3*) until it finds the point where the electron wavefunciton is equally localized between the two dots.\n",

However, further away from the resonant tunnel coupling point, we can sweep *V3* much faster.
